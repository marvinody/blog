# Hello, I am Manny
I am a software developer who enjoys making things. I've tried making stuff in person but it takes longer to iterate on ideas (although I love doing pixel art with my niece and nephew when they bust it out).

## Background
So I initially went to school for computer science but it ended up being way too theoretical (they didn't teach any git but expected people to work on group projects?) for me so I left it. I worked on a support team at a local Macy's and spent my time learning things by myself and building tiny fun projects. I eventually went to a bootcamp to solidify my practical knowledge and expand my network. And here I am!

## What do I do?
I make stuff! Sometimes I polish them, sometimes I leave them unfinished, but I always try to have active projects to work on. I actually have a huge list of ideas and anytime I get the itch to do something, I write it down. When I'm done (or satisfied) with a project, I pick a new one from the list. I've come to terms with the idea that I'll never have enough time for all my projects, but that's ok. The idea isn't to just have a bunch, the idea to learn from the ones that you do (at least for me).
