So if you read my about me, you know I like to make things. I like to make a lot of things.
A lot of those things turn out to be dropped because I think it's not worth to continue it or maybe I had to prioritize something else and it just happened to get dropped. Regardless, here's where I'll be listing (or attempting to list) all my past projects and maybe what I learned from them.
